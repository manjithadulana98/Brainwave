# Brainwave
This Project was done to the Brainwave 2021. Objective of this project is to compile a computational model to optimize a supply chain management on the side of the distribution and value added service location centers. We have use python on both front end and backend development. Python tkinter was used for the frontend development. the mainly used modules in python are **tkinter, numpy, scipy, pandas, ast**. Here the approach wasn't limited to the Dijkasra algorithm, since we went through the repeated nodes too.
